## Introduction

This project introduces Bridget as a web developer (frontend), it is used as a medium to show her previous works in the order of most recent to least recently deployed through an interactive simple user interface.

## Features

The order of arrangement features a simplistic user interface with two predominant sides as seen in the desktop view, the left side shows the projects she has completed by name while the right side loads up the mockup of the desktop view of these projects. The project name on the left will be a href link which when double tapped will lead you to a new page showing the project in view. I am considering loading this page as an Iframe in the current portfolio page (we'll see about that).

## Projects

The projects that are featured in this portfolio project include:

- restaurant
- wedding
- notification
- app
  etc

## future projects

As an engineer, Bridget has always been exposed to the beauty and relevance of representing ideas in drawing. Illustration and 2d are great, but with 3d, more insights can be shared about a product, project or an idea in order to inform and ultimately create leads. Therefore, I look forward to learning more about optimizing 3d designs for fluid user interaction in 3d websites.
